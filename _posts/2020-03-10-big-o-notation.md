# Big O Notation

### An intuitive understanding to describe the quickness of an algorithm. We do not mull over the formal definition as to not exhaust you. If you are in search of a challenge or a well chosen bedtime story -- see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" target="_blank">here</a>


## I need a metaphor

Say that we have a phone book with 26 names in it (one for each letter of the alphabet).

If we wanted to search for *Zoura Zubiri*, one strategy would be to go through the names one by one, until I reach Zoura. Lets say it takes me 1 second to read each name. So for the 26th name, it took me 26 seconds to reach Zoura.
